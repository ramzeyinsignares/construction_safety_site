    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <div class="card bio-card">
      <p>
        <strong>[Your Name]</strong> is a Construction Management student at
        <strong>California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo</strong>. Their academic
        interests include project planning, safety management, and the integration of emerging
        technologies into construction practice. Through coursework and independent research,
        they are exploring how data-informed decision-making and modern tools can be used to
        reduce risk and improve outcomes for workers and communities.

        This website was created as part of an academic advocacy project focused on construction
        safety. The goal is to present research findings in a format that is accessible to a
        general audience while maintaining an evidence-based, balanced perspective.

      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>
        The mission of this project is to promote greater awareness of construction worker safety
        and to highlight practical, research-supported strategies for reducing risk on job sites.
        By drawing attention to both technological innovations and policy opportunities, this
        advocacy work seeks to encourage informed conversations among community members, project
        owners, and decision-makers.
      </p>
      <p>
        At its core, this project is grounded in the belief that the people who build our homes,
        schools, and infrastructure deserve workplaces that prioritize their well-being. Safer
        construction is not only achievable—it is essential to a more just and sustainable future.
