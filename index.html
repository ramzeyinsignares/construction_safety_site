      <h2>Construction Safety: A Persistent Problem</h2>
      <p class="section-lead">
        Construction remains one of the most hazardous industries in the United States. Despite
        engineering advances and modern project delivery methods, thousands of workers are injured
        or killed each year in incidents that are often preventable.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to national safety data, construction consistently accounts for a disproportionate
        share of workplace fatalities. These incidents impact not only workers, but also families,
        communities, and industries that rely on safe and efficient infrastructure development.
        The core problem is clear: construction workers continue to face unacceptable levels of risk,
        and many current safety practices have not kept pace with the complexity of modern job sites.

        <h3>The Human Cost of Inaction</h3>
        <p>
          Falls, struck-by incidents, caught-in/between events, and electrocutions remain leading
          causes of death on construction sites. Each statistic represents a person whose life
          and livelihood was impacted by conditions that are, in many cases, preventable.

    <h2>A Dual Approach to Safer Construction</h2>
    <p class="section-lead">
      Improving worker safety requires a combined focus on <strong>emerging safety technologies</strong>
      and <strong>strong, enforceable safety policies</strong>. Technology alone cannot solve structural
      problems, and policy alone cannot monitor every hazard in real time. Together, they offer a path
      toward proactive, data-informed safety management.

        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p>
          Wearable sensors, artificial intelligence, drones, and virtual reality training can
          detect hazards, improve training retention, and provide real-time insight into safety
          conditions on active job sites.

        <h3>Policy Reform</h3>
        <p>
          Updated regulations, stronger enforcement, and incentives for safety innovation help
          ensure that best practices are implemented consistently, not just on high-profile projects.

        <h3>Worker Protection</h3>
        <p>
          At the center of both technology and policy is the lived experience of workers. Effective
          safety programs recognize worker expertise and protect those who report hazards.

    <h2>Addressing Concerns and Counterarguments</h2>
    <ul class="rebuttal-list">
      <li class="rebuttal-item">
        <strong>“Safety technology is too expensive for smaller contractors.”</strong>
        <span>
          While the initial investment can be significant, the long-term costs of accidents—medical
          expenses, project delays, legal actions, and increased insurance premiums—are often far
          higher. Grants, tax incentives, and insurance discounts can help make safety technologies
          more accessible to firms of all sizes.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li class="rebuttal-item">
        <strong>“Additional safety regulations slow down projects.”</strong>
        <span>
          Well-designed safety policies improve planning and communication, which can actually reduce
          rework and schedule disruptions. Preventing incidents keeps projects moving and protects
          both budgets and people.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li class="rebuttal-item">
        <strong>“Experienced workers already know how to stay safe.”</strong>
        <span>
          Experience is invaluable, but even highly skilled workers are vulnerable when faced with
          new technologies, compressed schedules, or changing site conditions. Ongoing training and
          modern tools support, rather than replace, professional judgment.
        </span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Advocacy Position:</strong>
      <span>
        A balanced approach that integrates evidence-based technology with thoughtful policy reform
        offers the most promising path toward safer, more sustainable construction practices.

    <h2>How You Can Support Safer Construction</h2>
    <p>
      Construction safety affects workers, families, and communities. By staying informed and
      supporting policies and practices that prioritize worker well-being, members of the public
      can help shape a safer built environment.
