Building Safer Futures – Static Website
=======================================

This folder contains a small static website for an academic advocacy project on construction
worker safety. The site is built with plain HTML and CSS and can be hosted on any basic web
server or static hosting platform (such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or a university server).

Files
-----

- index.html               – Home page (problem statement, advocacy overview, call to action)
- safety-technology.html   – Supporting page with details on safety technologies and policy
- about.html               – About the author and mission statement
- works-cited.html         – Works Cited page
- assets/style.css         – Shared stylesheet for all pages

How to Use
----------

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to preview the site locally.
2. To customize:
   - Replace `[Your Name]` in `about.html` with your actual name.
   - Add or edit sources in `works-cited.html` to match your technical report.
   - Adjust text as needed to reflect your research and instructor feedback.

How to Publish (Example: GitHub Pages)
--------------------------------------

1. Create a new GitHub repository.
2. Upload all files and folders from this directory to the repository.
3. In the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages and select the main branch as the source.
4. After a short delay, GitHub will provide a public URL where your site is hosted.

Alternatively, you can upload these files to another static hosting service such as Netlify
or to a personal or university web server.
